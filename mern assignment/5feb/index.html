    <h1> I LOVE PUNE</h1>
    <p>Pune (Marathi: [puɳe] (audio speaker iconlisten); English: /ˈpuːnə/; formerly known as Poona, the official name until 1978) is the seventh most populous city in India and the second-largest city in the state of Maharashtra, with an estimated population of 7.4 million as of 2020.[18][19][20][21] It has been ranked as "the most liveable city in India" several times.[22] Along with the municipal corporation limits of PCMC and the three cantonment towns of Camp, Khadki and Dehu Road, Pune forms the urban core of the eponymous Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR).[23]

        According to the 2011 census the urban area had a combined population of 5.05 million whilst the population of the metropolitan region was estimated at 7.4 million.[9] Situated 560 metres (1,837 feet) above sea level on the Deccan plateau on the right bank of the Mutha river,[24] Pune is also the administrative headquarters of its namesake district.
        
        In the 18th century, the city was the seat of the Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire and one of the most important political centres on the Indian subcontinent.[25] The city was also ruled by the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, the Mughals and the Adil Shahi dynasty. Historical landmarks include Lal Mahal, the Kasba Ganapati temple and Shaniwar Wada. Major historical events involving the city include the Mughal–Maratha Wars and the Anglo-Maratha Wars.
        
        Pune is widely regarded as the second major "IT hub of India"[26][27] and the top "automobile and manufacturing hub of India".[28] It is known as the Oxford of the East with the presence of a wide range of educational institutions.[29][30] India's first indigenously run girls' school was started in Pune by Savitribai Phule. The city has emerged as a major educational hub in recent decades, with nearly half of the total number of international students in the country studying in Pune.[31][32] Research institutes of information technology, education, management and training attract students and professionals from India and overseas.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

    <h1>The Maratha Empire</h1>
    <p>Pune was part of the Jagir (fiefdom) granted to Maloji Bhosale in 1599 for his services to the Nizamshahi (Ahmadnagar Sultanate).[37] Pune was ruled by the Ahmadnagar Sultanate until it was annexed by the Mughals in the 17th century. Maloji Bhosale's grandson, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the Maratha Empire, was born at the fort of Shivneri, about 90 km from Pune.[38] It changed hands several times between the Mughals and the Marathas in the period 1680 to 1705.

        After the destruction of the town in raids by the Adil Shahi dynasty in 1630 and again between 1636 and 1647, Dadoji Konddeo, the successor to Dhadphale, oversaw the reconstruction of the town. He stabilised the revenue collection and administrative systems of the areas around Pune and the neighbouring Maval region. He also developed effective methods to manage disputes and to enforce law and order.[39] The Lal Mahal was commissioned in 1631 and construction was completed in 1640 AD.[33] Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj spent his young years at the Lal Mahal. His mother, Jijabai is said to have commissioned the building of the Kasba Ganapati temple. The Ganesha idol consecrated at this temple has been regarded as the presiding deity (Gramadevata) of the city.[40]
        
        From 1703 to 1705, towards the end of the 27-year-long Mughal–Maratha Wars, the town was occupied by Aurangzeb and its name was changed to Muhiyabad.[20][41] But the name was erased soon after Aurangzeb's death.</p>
